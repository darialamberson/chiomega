			        <h2>About Us</h2>
				        <p>The Nu Alpha chapter was installed on March 6, 1915. Chi Omega continued on campus until 1944, when the university banned sororities. Chi Omega was re-instated on May 25, 1991 and has been present ever since. With approximately 100 members today, Nu Alpha is going strong. A constant recipient of recognition from Nationals for its strong performance, Nu Alpha also boasts a 3.6 average G.P.A., one of the highest across the country. Furthermore, two scholarships are awarded to Stanford Chi Os every year; one from Nationals and another from Stanford.</p>

				        <h2>Chi Omega History</h2>
				        <p>It all began on April 5, 1895 when 4 women from the University of Arkansas, with the help of a local dentist, established the secrets, symbolism, and rites that today bind over 240,000 women together. Inspired by the need for an organization that  appreciated and respected the potential and inherent value of women, this group built Chi Omega with six principles in mind. These are friendship, high standards of personnel, sincere learning and creditable scholarship, participation in campus activities, career and personal development, and community service. Today Chi Omega has grown to be the largest national sorority, initiating more than 5,000 women annually.</p>
