			        <h2>Sisterhood</h2>
				      <p>Chi Omegas are not only sisters, but also best friends. From the excitement of getting or giving amazing presents everyday during Big/Little Week to having a shoulder to cry on during a bad breakup, your sisters will always be there for you.</p>
					  <p>Part of friendship is loving each friend for who she truly is.  Chi Omega recognizes this and, thus, encourages each member to be herself.  After all, it is each of our individual talents that makes us special.  However, no matter how amazing each woman is on her own, we are all stronger and most successful when we come together as a group. This sentiment can be seen throughout much of Chi Omega life, but is especially evident in our Symphony. Chi Omega views each member as a single instrument, crucial and unique. However, it is only when we all come together, like an orchestra, that we can make a symphony.</p>

		        <h2>The Symphony</h2>
		        <p>Written by Ethel Switzer Howard in 1904 on the eve of her initiation into the Xi Chapter at Northwestern University, the Symphony was eventually adopted nationally as the example of what every Chi O should aspire to be.</p>
		        <p class="symphony">"To live constantly above snobbery of word or deed;<br>
						to place scholarship before social obligations and character before appearances;<br>
						to be, in the best sense, democratic rather than 'exclusive', and lovable rather than 'popular';<br>
						to work earnestly, to speak kindly, to act sincerely, to choose thoughtfully that course which occasion and conscience demand;<br>
						to be womanly always;<br>
						to be discouraged never;<br>
						in a word, to be loyal under any and all circumstances to my Fraternity and her highest teachings and to have her welfare ever at heart that she may be a symphony of high purpose and helpfulness in which there is no discordant note."</p>
