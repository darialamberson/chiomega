					    <h2>Recruitment</h2>
					    <p>Welcome! My name is Crystal Bryan, and I am the Recruitment Chair for the Nu Alpha Chapter of Chi Omega. Spring Formal Recruitment at Stanford is a whirlwind process, but it is also a fantastic opportunity to learn what the Stanford Greek Community has to offer. The mutual selection process ensures that each woman finds exactly what she is looking for in a chapter. For me, joining Chi Omega meant finding a group of elegant, thoughtful, and beautiful ladies to call my sisters &mdash; they support me and truly are my Stanford family. I found friends, I found countless adventures, and I became part of an organization that has immeasurably changed my college experience for the better. See for yourself! I encourage you to wander through our website and discover all that Chi Omega has to offer. Spring Formal Recruitment 2012 will begin in April, and I hope to see your smiling face then! Check out the Stanford ISC website for more information regarding the Inter-Sorority Council, Greek life, and registration, and please don't hesitate to contact me with any questions at cmbryan@stanford.edu. I look forward to meeting each and every one of you, and introducing you to the amazing women of Chi Omega! Go Cardinal, and Go Greek!</p>
